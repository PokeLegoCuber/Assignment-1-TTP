		<p>Team8Hunger serves as the main food distribution hub for hundreds of partner
			 agencies that comprise the emergency food network in our eleven county service region across 
			 central and northern New York. The Food Bank provides more than 14 million pounds of food – 
			 the equivalent of 12.1 million meals – to hungry families, children, and elderly every year.</p>

		<p><b>Advocating:</b> The Food Bank will continue to educate all levels of government on the importance of 
			increasing funding for government programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
			(SNAP), Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the School 
			Breakfast Program (SBP). In the interim, we will also educate on the important role that food banks, 
			food pantries, and soup kitchens have in filling the gap. Join us in asking your elected officials to 
			help end hunger by signing up for our advocacy alerts and calls to action <a href = "https://www.google.com/">here</a>.</p>

		<p><b>Collaborating:</b> We are committed to working closely with our partner agencies on best practice initiatives. 
			Get involved with your local food pantry or soup kitchen to see how you can help strengthen their capacity. </p>
		
		<p><b>Communicating:</b> Hunger is a solvable problem in the United States but we need enough voices to demand action. 
			If you are interested in participating in these conversations, or would like to host a presentation to teach 
			others, please call us at (315) 437-1899.</p>
		
		<p>Established in 1985, the organization is considered one of the most efficient food banks in the country, using 
			every $1.00 donated to help provide three meals to hungry families, children, and elderly. Team8Hunger is a member 
			of Feeding America.</p>
